## Introduction

Neural network regression is a powerful technique used to model complex relationships between input features and continuous target values. TensorFlow, along with other libraries like NumPy, Pandas, 
Matplotlib, and Seaborn, provides an excellent environment for developing regression models. This repository aims to help you understand and implement neural network regression with practical examples.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using these tutorials, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (install it using `pip install tensorflow`)
- NumPy (install it using `pip install numpy`)
- Pandas (install it using `pip install pandas`)
- Matplotlib (install it using `pip install matplotlib`)
- Seaborn (install it using `pip install seaborn`)

## Installation

To get started, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreyans3700/Neural-Network-Regression-.git
```

Once you have the repository on your local machine, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Neural-Network-Regression-
```

You can then follow the tutorials in the `tutorials` directory.

## Tutorials

This repository includes the following tutorials:

1. Introduction to Neural Networks**: An introductory tutorial that explains the basic concepts of neural networks and how they can be used for regression tasks.

2. Data Preprocessing**: Learn how to prepare and preprocess your data for neural network regression, including data normalization, feature scaling, and handling missing values.

3. Building a Neural Network Model**: Walk through the process of designing and building a neural network model using TensorFlow.

4. Training and Evaluation**: Understand the training process, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating the performance of your regression model.

5. Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Learn how to visualize your regression results using Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights from your data.

Feel free to explore these tutorials in order or jump to the specific topics that interest you the most.
